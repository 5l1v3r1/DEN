~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Hi guys !! I am Vishnu aka 34gLe 3ye.. I love to present you a python tool that encrypts the metasploit payload called "DEN" It will allow you to create an encrypted payload  which can evade countermeasures.It can be used for both 64 and 32 bit OS..Try this..


	Usage : run these in the terminal with root privilages...
		tar xvf DEN.tar
		apt-get install x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc  .. Run the tool with root privilages.. Run in the terminal as "python den.py"
		Just answer the queries.. I have used the same technique used in crypter (Thanks a lot for the motivation).. This tool is simple as you can run it from a root terminal or using sudo..
